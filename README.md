# Debiasing Multi-Language Large Vision-Language Models

## Context

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly popular and influential in e-commerce, retail, content creation, and fashion. Despite their growing utility, these models are known to inherit social biases from their underlying vision and language components. The research aims to address these biases, particularly in the context of non-English-speaking users, and to make LVLMs more accessible and equitable.
